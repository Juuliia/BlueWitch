# BlueWitch
BlueWitch is a project developed as part of my university coursework in 2023. This game invites players to explore a mystical world filled with magic and mystery, where they encounter magical creatures and are in a constant search for their lost necklace.

Created using C#, BlueWitch represents my initial venture into game development. While the plot is not deeply developed, the game still provides a coherent main flow that allows players to experience adventure and exploration. This project serves as a significant milestone in my growth as a game developer and is shared here to illustrate my progress compared to my newer projects.

Please note that BlueWitch was developed using free assets and is intended for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. I kindly ask that you do not republish or redistribute the game in any form. It is meant for free use only, and any commercial use or distribution is not permitted. Your feedback is greatly appreciated, as it helps me continue to learn and improve. Thank you for your support and understanding!
