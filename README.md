# BlueWitch
BlueWitch is a project I developed during my university coursework in 2023 as my very first attempt at creating a game. It served as an introduction to game development, allowing me to explore the fundamentals of building a 2D RPG. In this game, players venture through a magical world, encounter mystical creatures, and uncover the story of the Blue Witch. While the plot is simple, it reflects my early efforts to create an engaging and immersive experience.

Developed with C#, BlueWitch represents my initial steps in game development and provides a valuable comparison to my more recent projects. The game uses free assets and was created for educational and personal use. Please refrain from republishing or commercializing the game. Your feedback is much appreciated and will help me continue refining my skills and improve future projects. Thank you for your support!
